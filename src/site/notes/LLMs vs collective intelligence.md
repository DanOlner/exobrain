Need to understand firm collective intelligence before any idea about LLM impact.

This is pretty key. How would it be possible to understand firm level LLM impacts (restricting to that, let's not label it all AI) without understanding how human collective intelligence and structures are working?

- [ ] Chat with Nick - what's the role of human knoweldge structures in engineering design? I think I recall he said it's built in, but how exactly? In what ways does that affect how any new tech works, especially if it's purporting to replace not support human knowledge connections? Nick's pointed towards: [ARP4754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP4754), [DO178C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178C).
