Need to understand firm collective intelligence before any idea about LLM impact.

This is pretty key. How would it be possible to understand firm level LLM impacts (restricting to that, let's not label it all AI) without understanding how human collective intelligence and structures are working?

- [ ] Chat with Nick - what's the role of human structures in engineering design. I know he said it's built in, but how exactly? More deets!
