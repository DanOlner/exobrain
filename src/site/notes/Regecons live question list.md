# What's this page?

A place where I'll update questions about regional economies I'm chewing over and add in any others (with acknowledgements obv) that I've picked up from reading or chats.

I'll break it down into different kinds of question. Though picking any one question inevitably pulls on other threads, let's see if we can keep it at least moderately sane. I will aim to write self-contained little pieces discussing each and how they connect, where appropriate with some data analysis.

# Topics to cover

With exobrain sub-pages linked if made.

- [[Econ error rates\|Econ error rates]]
- Uncertainty. Connects to error rates but is a bit different - some of that is already in [[Econ error rates\|Econ error rates]]. Ranks, the power of the single number.
- [[National accounts\|National accounts]] (probably no replacement possible given its status as global accounting system responsible e.g. for regional funding allocation; possible to work alongside it?)
- Wild deflators - telecoms example (see growth point below and links in [[Planners/Productivity digging\|Productivity digging]])
- Imputed rent, the numbers. And why it's a reflection of the 'accounting' part of national accounts / the need to align nations. But then, is that really any use for understanding regional development?
- Public sector output - as an example for thinking through the implications of top-down slicing of output (in this case based purely on average public sector pay times job number, used to slice a nationally estimated pound value up between regions).
- Tradeable vs foundational - thinking about the whole economy (some stuff coming out of the intermediate links work that suggests this is more complex).

# Intro

A few words on the spirit of this work, going back to [a point I was mulling back in 2018](https://coveredinbees.org.archived.website/node/485.html). I've just been re-reading a [2023 post by Richard Murphy](GDP are an honest attempt to do something that is conceptually and technically very difficult – and there are honest debates about what to include and what not to include.) about [imputed rent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent) (the rent that would be paid if owner-occupier houses were rented). It has - shock! - a really polite, critical, well-informed comment thread. Richard starts off with a GOTCHA claim: imputed rent isn't real! "10% of GDP is made up – it simply does not exist in the real world". Just another example, he says, showing how ridiculous national accounts are.

A commenter [replies](https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2023/02/14/10-or-gdp-is-made-up-it-simply-does-not-exist-in-the-real-world/#comment-920070):

>  I really do wish you’d dial back the language a bit! GDP are an honest attempt to do something that is conceptually and technically very difficult – and there are honest debates about what to include and what not to include.

I want to keep my own discussions firmly grounded in that respect for work done by much smarter people than me, often under extreme pressure. The ONS, especially in recent years, has taken a bit of a beating despite doing phenomenal work with less money and a much harder survey landscape. Politicians will spin the tiniest percentage point change in GDP, causing stampedes this way and that. None of it's conducive to having those calm, honest debates that commenter wishes for.

But let's try.

I want to be guided by what's useful for understanding regional economies. National accounts are just that - national - and issues arise straight away from re-purposing those tools for subnational thinking.


The thread of questions will circle round - data thoughts lead into "what are we trying to understand" leads into "what theories do we have in our brains? What assumptions can we see, which can't we?" Those circle back round... 



# Questions

- [ ] Top level one: given all this, what should it mean for how UK regions think about their own development? Can we collectively come up with better ways to do this?

The problem there includes: economics' general commitment to spurious accuracy, or more specifically national accounts (economics has econometrics...) Also: ranking is very, very hard to let go of even if you know it's dumb. See: UK universities using THES rankings - dropping in and out of the top 100 is the difference between international student numbers halving or doubling in some fields. It matters. It shouldn't. It does. Cf. Richard Harris trying to push this boulder up the hill...

[Via this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-does-investment-go-furthest-wales-ieuan-best-wsg6e/?trackingId=gMGJQXJMSsCMzkq8Rvl5xg%3D%3📅 ) on using the Welsh IO tables.


# What do we want to know and why?

And how does this change the kinds of questions we need to ask, as well as where to look for answers?

A lot of things come under this heading:

- If we want to support development in a region, what's the balance between 'picking winners' (leaning into existing economic strengths a region already has) versus thinking holistically (how to develop an entire region's economy, thinking across sectors and siloes)?
	- See e.g. [Giles Wilkes' piece](https://freethinkecon.wordpress.com/2024/10/22/innovation-competition-and-pitfalls-of-the-sector-method/) on the Pitfalls of the Sector Method and GVA factory thinking for some common ways to go awry with winner-picking.
	- The whole picture includes the foundational economy ([Welsh gov page](https://www.gov.wales/foundational-economy) explaining the concept) - something my Y-PERN colleagues at Sheffield Hallam / CRESR have done amazing work on. One good way to define foundational economy jobs might be "anyone who still had to leave the house to work during COVID". The pandemic drew attention to a harsh, paradoxical truth - those jobs were (a) entirely essential to making sure the country didn't fall over and (b) on average, among the worst-paid jobs (with obvious exceptions). They are also the largest percent of any regional economy (CRESR's work on this has it at 69% of all jobs in South Yorkshire).

A different but similar axis: 
* Claim: focus on [tradeable jobs](https://whatworksgrowth.org/insights/understanding-tradable-non-tradable-sectors/), as growing these is the quickest route to strong growth. These jobs are almost always the opposite of foundational ones - any job/sector that makes goods and services that can be traded *outside* the region. 
	* The theoretical foundation comes from (I think) [this Rice & Venables working paper](https://www.productivity.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WP021-Tradability-Productivity-and-RD-FINAL-240622.pdf) for the Productivity Institute. From a quick read, it looks like it's re-stating [Ricardian comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage) for UK regions pretty much exactly. So all the same arguments and counter-arguments for international trade as inter-regional apply (though of course domestic context adds plenty of wrinkles).
* The claim continues: those tradeable jobs are the linchpin of any region; the wage rates of service / foundational sectors are higher in places with better tradeable jobs because there's more internal demand for them. While this is clearly a chunk of the economic story, it's also worth considering the ways non-tradeable sectors feed into overall regional productivity - they aren't just passive beneficiaries of tradeable 'trickle down'.
	* But foundational jobs / sectors trade across borders too. How different are they in terms of cross-regional purchases, if looking at intermediate links? Might be some answers in the industry to industry payment data...

What scale to deepen connections between?
- Strengthen them within a region (e.g. build a West Yorkshire tram system) or between them (cancel that and put money instead into improved services between Northern cities?)
	- Both, of course. But - what's the theory on the relative ROI for each approach, and why? Cf. the arg between Paul Swinney and West Mids.

## What is real growth? Why is it all so mad?

See e.g. the telecoms stuff in [[Planners/Productivity digging\|Productivity digging]].

Here's a comment for this Calvin Jones post on digital:

My brain is a bit scrambled by how digital services are measured anyway. Their value shift since all the early 2020s adjustments are boggling - see the plot here: the telecoms sector's chained volume measure increased by a *hundred and fifty times* (index of 0.7 in 1998 up to 106.1 in 2023). Whereas its proportion of the economy in pounds went from 1.92% in 1998 to 1.45% in 2023 - i.e. *dropped* by * 0.75ish. I can go through the CV vs CP numbers and I think just about get the quality-adjusted volume / pounds per bit justifications, but it still melts my noggin - mainly along "if growth can be this reliant on model choices and what deflator theory we like, what does it really mean??" lines. Thoughts gratefully received! Cf. the Brookings paper. https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WP58_Abdirahman-et-al-1.pdf


# Regecon journal

## [[4th-Feb-2026\|4th-Feb-2026]]: reflective writing on the whole regecon thing

Trying to get started on this. See [[Exobrain diary#^4779eb\|Exobrain diary#^4779eb]] for thoughts on going with the brain grain.

I have a first sentence to put on LinkedIn anyway: "Seems to me there's a bit of a shortage of White Blokes Expressing Strong Opinions about Regional Economics on here, so thought I'd add my tuppence."

What I'd like first, though, is just to shape what I think this is going to be, and some way to maximise the odds it'll progress. 


## Bits on uncertainty article 1 [[5th-Feb-2026\|5th-Feb-2026]]

See [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/ukproductivityintroduction/latest#data-sources-and-quality)? "Imputed rental is excluded from "Industry L: real estate" because including it would distort productivity measures, since the output is mainly an imputed value rather than a result of labour or market service provision."

I was told it's included. Excluding would seem sensible to me, but... well, that's something we can check against the CP totals. Ah no - that was regional GDP figures, not productivity. That needs checking.

Note also 'strengths / limitations' in the [latest subregional thingyo](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/regionalandsubregionallabourproductivityuk/2023#data-sources-and-quality). Points out it gets volatile below ITL1.

Oh - I asked about regional GDP figures. Let's see if I can check on productivity figures. I'll check totals (as I've done before) and then email.

Oh ah 2: CIs are in the LFS / APS hours worked data - I can grab that from NOMIS. Would be good to check it roughly aligns with hours in the prod stuff. But let's see (or possibly just nab the CIs and apply them).

..

OK, got a reasonable way just with the ABS and linking to region/industry GVA (the usual sector mismatch faff). Just want to list some things to aim for before calling it done:

- Use exactly the same approach for current prices, and put some bounds around locations quotients at ITL1 level.
- Make some assumptions about SEs scaling to smaller geographies and do the same, maybe showing how much uncertainty bounds could increase.
	- This may require thinking through how whole-economy growth numbers come out of its underlying parts, which might be a bit much for a first post.

I can leave those last ones open for another post. I think here - get to 'error bars for LQS at ITL1' and that will be plenty to make the point. I can then list the other things we can check later e.g. testing the rank issue. Implications include the kind of league table thinking we see when comparing to EU cities: "UK cities should be like x or y but... " Soooo many reasons we can't be sure about that. But - as we show here - quantifying uncertainty can bring a new, better kind of certainty! (Could link to man crossing bridge point.)

## Doing LQ uncertainty bounds [[9th-Feb-2026\|9th-Feb-2026]]

... is slightly trickier. I was trying to find LQs separately for central, min and max but I realise that actually doesn't make sense (having seen the batty CIs) - they won't sum correctly, will they? Think this through a bit.
- The central GVA estimate gets summed across all places, and against other sector sizes too both regionally and nationally. So the variation in the sizes of those is going to wamp out totals isn't it? Though I'm struggling a bit to visualise how.
- Possibly I should be **holding all other values constant**, not using mins and maxes for everything - or more likely, using the CIs values to simulate what the values could be. That's probably a better idea.
..
Just running through each SIC2 after some claude-code sims on LQs. To pick out some that jump out.
	- CCI: biiiig error bars there. 
	- Human health...
	- Land transport:  that's really nice, you can see the COVID signal very clearly in many places.


## Plan for writing / actually, broader plan

Think there's enough data and tools for this now! Let's just run through what I've got and give myself a sense of what I'm going to write about.

- First say what the GVA data is / how I'm using it. 

..

Scratch that last bit. I've been thinking about what this writing project is, and a few things are happening:
- The new exobrain system is, I think, beginning to work. It is going with my grain and allowing some larger stuff to happen.
- I want to get out these reflections, but as I've worked on it, it's become apparent that - if I wanted to - I could make it something a bit more official.
- But in doing that, I also want to balance openness and protection i.e. that this is my work, but I want to collaborate.
- AND! It offers ways to experiment with academic writing - or rather, the kind of knowledge work where we want things to progress, collaboration to be possible, traceable systems to exist. The 'open feedback and protection' thread in chatGPT has a lot of useful links.

Now then. I am of course concerned about mission creep, and about getting dragged in a wrong direction that I don't have time for. But... I think this does all go with the grain of what I want to do, and gives me a chance to do this on my own terms.

But it'll take a little bit of planning. The writing in [[Regecons reflections 1\|Regecons reflections 1]] is all good and useful, but it may end up in different places. 

Though it that: I want to include the Lost Boys thing. Academic writing schmacademic schmiting.

Let's try and braindump the things I want to test with this:
- NOT the [preprint model](https://www.ntu.ac.uk/media/documents/library/preprints_faq.pdf) ("a complete (full draft version) manuscript shared with a public audience without peer review") i.e. the full working paper. Or not that being the 'first public view' stage. That's too late, and I want it to be more modular. I was thinking this looking at the list of focus points above - what's in, what's out, what's 'complete'? 
- Headlines at the top for policy implications. Doesn't need to be a fancy-graphic'd two pager. Policymakers can read headlines. I though [Manski's paper here](https://mea.sites.grinnell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/manski_mea_address.pdf) had a nice structure for that - very, very clear top level points.
	- See also LLM ideas for modular policy engagement [[LLMoutput/Modular open publishing workflow\|here]] (part 5).


Here's what I think the modular order could look like:
- **This first set of uncertainty examples**. I can then ask: what am I getting horribly wrong here? What assumptions are wrong? Try and get a bit of feedback, though stating things clearly so they can be clearly refuted. Have em as hypotheses.
	- Which can include the Manski 
- Module 2: uncertainty in policymaking lit review / thoughts. I need to start with some of those, but then deeper dive?
- Module 3: applying that to how we're thinking about industrial strategy and place. Or whatever else becomes relevant.

That can sit within the wider goals this doc talks about.

OK, if that's the order of things... what goes where? I think what I want is the following:
- Introductory CiB post on what I'm doing. That'll be some of the gumph from [[Regecons reflections 1\|Regecons reflections 1]].
- Actual modular component within its own github repo. That needs to be smaller and more compact than the existing [regecontools site](https://github.com/DanOlner/RegionalEconomicTools), and can have DOI refs. Modules can be assembled there. I may want to just directly write in RStudio for that, keep the obsidian/CiB crossover for the blog?
	- Yeah, quick test - RStudio automatically makes a bibliography.tex file so the bib auto-compiles. It doesn't here.
