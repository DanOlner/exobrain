One on tying in with running / composting the connections while doing that

# Obsidian / exobraining the sci-fi book? [[2025-12-13\|2025-12-13]]

The thought: since [the original post](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/i_wrote_a_scifi_book/) about a 'get sci-fi book live' plan on CiB, it's become apparent the process I was embarking on was much wider. The book is part of it, but it's also gone into full re-assess-brainsystems mode, in light of trying to figure out how to work with my brain, not just smash it against the wall while blaming myself ([last CiB post](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/why-make-things-simple/)).

A few things flow from that:
- The book gets embedded in everything else in the exobrain. I can smush it all together and to an extent not worry about that mess or where it goes.
- It's only really in the last week that I've thought  - ah, all this ridiculousness actually did have a point. This is now feeling like pushing on an open door, not trying to... how did I put in a text? "I WILL SHAME MYSELF INTO BEING A BETTER, FITTER, HAPPIER, MORE PRODUCTIVE PERSON." Quite. After many abortive attempts trying other avenues, this latest collection of things is feeling like something that's (a) on my own terms entirely and (b) is actually getting out of the way and letting me just flow a bit more. Might be worth coming back and chewing over why exactly that is - it has reduced barriers to me just turning up,  quite how, I don't know -  but for now, let's just continue to test - it's early days, plenty of time for early promise to flounder. But... testing continues.
	- Quick reflection on this: I don't think it's incidental that it's an open system I have full, transparent control over. Nothing and no-one is trying to tie me into a closed system. That is allowing a fluidity that is absolutely working for me. That's interesting. That may also apply to the book, which I suspect will be coming out of Scrivener into here. (There is of course an [Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/kevboh/longform) for that...)
- I am mulling picking on scenes from the book and working through them openly to piece the whole together. That way I can partly tell the story as it goes, though not necessarily linearly, and in ways that may alter as we go.
	- Doing this, I'm mulling how to connect to people who might be interested in this fairly odd way of doing things.

So, picking a single scene - [[oldscript/oldscript_scenes/Hill -- Outside line\|Hill/Rem first]]...
