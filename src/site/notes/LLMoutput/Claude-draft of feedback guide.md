# How to Give Feedback on This Work

*All feedback on this project — questions, suggestions, corrections, challenges — is welcome. This guide explains how feedback works and how to contribute, whether or not you use GitHub.*

---

## Where Feedback Lives

All feedback is logged as **GitHub Issues** on the project repository. This creates a single, public, timestamped record of the conversation around the work — who raised what, when, and how it was addressed.

You can browse existing feedback and discussion here:
**[GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/DanOlner/RegionalEconomicTools/issues)**

---

## You Don't Need to Use GitHub

If you'd prefer to get in touch directly — by **email**, **LinkedIn**, or any other route — that's completely fine. The only thing that's different is what happens next:

- I'll summarise your feedback as a GitHub Issue so it becomes part of the project record.
- **I will only do this with your express permission.** I'll check with you first and share the draft issue so you can confirm it captures your point fairly.
- If you'd prefer your feedback to be **anonymous** or **unattributed**, just say so — I'll log it without identifying you (e.g. "Feedback from local authority analyst" or similar).
- If you'd rather your feedback stayed **entirely private**, that's fine too. It won't appear on GitHub at all.

The goal is a useful public record of how the work develops through conversation — but never at the cost of anyone's comfort or position.

## If You Want to Use GitHub Directly

Using GitHub lets you post feedback yourself, follow the discussion, and get notified when your point is addressed. Here's how.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (one-time, ~2 minutes)

Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) and follow the steps. It's free. You'll need an email address.

### Step 2: Go to the Issues Page

Go to the project's Issues page:
**[github.com/DanOlner/RegionalEconomicTools/issues](https://github.com/DanOlner/RegionalEconomicTools/issues)**

### Step 3: Click "New Issue"

You'll see a green **"New Issue"** button near the top right. Click it.

### Step 4: Write Your Feedback

You'll get a simple form with two fields:

- **Title** — a short summary of your point. It helps to reference the specific piece of work, e.g.:
  - `[Expected vs Observed Flows] Question about LA-level data availability`
  - `[Regional Accounts Method] Suggestion on handling nonresponse`
  - `General: thoughts on the adaptive diversification framing`
- **Body** — your comment in as much or as little detail as you like. Plain text is fine. You can also paste links, and drag-and-drop images if helpful.

### Step 5: Click "Submit New Issue"

That's it. I'll be notified and will respond.

## What Happens to Your Feedback

- All issues are **labelled** by topic and source (e.g. `method-question`, `data-request`, `policy-implication`) so the conversation stays navigable.
- When feedback leads to a change in the work, the issue is updated to say how — e.g. "Incorporated into module v0.3" or "Addressed in blog post X" — and then closed.
- If your feedback is referenced in a publication or working paper, you'll be credited (unless you've asked to remain anonymous).

I aim to respond to all feedback. If a point leads to a change, I'll reference the issue in the updated work.

## A Note for Civil Servants and Public Sector Colleagues

I'm particularly keen to hear from people working with regional data, subnational statistics, and local economic policy. Your practical knowledge of how these numbers are produced and used is exactly the kind of feedback that strengthens this work.

I understand that commenting publicly may not always be straightforward in your role. The options above are designed with that in mind:

- You can email or message me directly, and I'll check before logging anything publicly.
- You can be anonymous or unattributed — just let me know.
- You can ask for feedback to stay entirely private.

Whatever works for you.
