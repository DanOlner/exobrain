Where I've been storing random thoughts as they've occurred pre-Obsidian.

..

Looking for ways to improve point of John peel. A thought: make John / Hill comms more explicit early on. John trying to help Hill find him, track him down, work out what's happening. That would allow Hill and Remzi to try to figure out more clues, and provide some basis for John to poke at things that might help reveal. Ipai still gets to know comms have been happening? That needs mulling too.

..

Richard Whittle: <https://theconversation.com/what-could-burst-the-ai-bubble-267136>

A thought off the back of that - can I trace a line of tech dev from this, through all the IP stuff, to the IPAI and voice system? \[That part's a bit odd and extreme, but that's the fun thought experiment part.\] p.s. I need to check Black Mirror hasn't yet done it!

..

John: wall is holographic. It's just him, easy nuff for 3D. Not until much later (house memories) that he's open that he knows it's his dad. I might want to get their mum into this story somehow better too.

That means changing what happens when it becomes apparent it's not just holographic, it's interacting with it. That has lots of possibilities including what ipai is pursuing. What are options here?

..

"This film suffers from what I call "mystery box syndrome" - it thinks that withholding information automatically makes a story compelling, regardless of whether the actual answers are worth the wait." <https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1mnmshm/weapons_2025_am_i_missing_something_this_movie/>

This is a good point. Mull. "Oh, they're brother and sister. Yeah that's a thing that could happen." That's less interesting, isn't it, than what we can get story-wise from that relationship, or how they try to find each other. Also letting the reader know early on (opening) means that's got some tension to it. But what to give away, what not to?

..

"Musk is selling science fiction. Hence the cyber truck design, the Murderbot androids, and HAL the computer AGI. It will be med beds next." <https://www.ft.com/content/21ec5a5f-0e9a-49b9-b64d-9ebc88e70aa7?commentID=13b1fcbf-e51f-4890-9e56-0616390d1f75>

As in: robot pods that cure you. Prob need a bit more background on that in my head for the book! Cf. Alysium \[only thing holding back curing poor is not allowing it / artificial scarcity of healthcare.\]

..

More on their mum and dad: maybe dad's lens / hologram tech was a key breakthrough for AI learning? Prob not cos we don't want that to be so recent... could that many changes happen that quickly. Would be good to involve / flesh out ma side too.

.. Back story - lean more into "AI was used to create structure that "solved" polarisation and emergent fascism" (subtly!) .. Second (?) John scene where he brings up his grandma's talkbox, mulls thinking Medic's a person - it's clumsy (and only there to link to later). I need to much more carefully think through what he says here and why / how it ties to the person idea I'm bringing up elsewhere (with mucho LLM overlap of course).

But how to do light-touch personhood thing? Maybe make it flippant. "I can anthropomorphise anything. I got guilt about taking my old washing machine to be scrapped. School trained us on this but I can't help it. I'm more like my grandma...." But the point? ..

For the Judy mulling. <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4626276#paper-citations-widget> See e.g. <file:///home/dano/Downloads/ssrn-5098708.pdf> - "Judge AI: Assessing Large Language Models in Judicial Decision-Making" (Will AI judges replace humans? Nope.)

.

It will need a better theory of provenance guarantees. Polly and Judy have that built in. (Just thinking about Dunt's concern here: "I got an image of the person compiling a series of Chat GPT inquiries. 'Please provide a list of the kind of people it would be suitable to approach about this topic, along with a short description of their professional work." " <https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=1833442&post_id=171638661&utm_source=post-email-title>

In the book, that's not happening - which suggests something occurred to draw lines around what AI was and wasn't allowed to do, while AI manages it \[sidepoint: someone has to point out - other places have vastly different approaches; that should be in the auction maybe... oh I say that below too\]. I then need reasons why anyone would trust just voices over a phone. How does Judy/Polly monitor that, or say they do? If it's as strong as physics, how has Ipai got round it?

One idea then: used Bernard as a proxy, got far enough into the brain stuff to be able to use him. That gives him another small role. How can I make that as weird as possible? It also means he could even be in the room with Hill - the buzzer is the door. And that makes their meeting at the end more interesting.

The polly/judy conditions for the law may be watertight, so that Bernard work would have to fit - the speech would on some level need to be his. Also makes Medic saying "we did some hacky stuff", can hint at, is more fun. And then law updated after of course.

Or hint at that, but then it could just be an earpiece! Old fashioned way. Except that should be illegal right? Something in Judy that says: words "must originate from a human mind". These are the limits of agent use, just to protect ownership. How this changes the writers' room, I am not sure.

Yeah, no, make a really weird elaborate way around the physics-like legal restrictions. Judy/Polly not omniscient, and some protection in uni grounds still.

Oh yes of course - Dunt points out: "The Voight-Kampff test - basically the Turing test - is established to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional responses." So that needs a little thought about what we're saying here... \[also, it's not basically the turing test!\]

Other parts of the world can have very different mixes of this. Can lay out all the range of pol types - full dystopia, places with "free agents" etc. Can have some hint about how this particular settlement arose.

..

Writers room: they ban AI use (except that's ridiculous cos ipai manages it and entai makes it... entai!)

"But they're NOT their own thoughts." "They think they are tho."

So react when it appears Hill is cheating. "Are you using an earpiece? You fucker, that gets us banned!" "Wait though, we're winning." But then get over it when they see how much they're winning.

Update thought on that: it's a contrast to what's happened elsewhere, where entai is basically the monopolist, feeding off inputs from everywhere and churning out anything that's required. Think that through some more, and what relationship "creators" might want to have to that.

So they *believe* they're being authentic in this situation, despite it being a managed network (how do the talking heads for the shows work? Maybe it's shifted... if there ended up being a law meaning that "meaning" had to originate in human thought, for example.)

Which is maybe what several of the situations are about - checking for human input, but the blend of that with machines blah. Is there something interesting to do there?

The Writers' room should really bounce off this kind of thing: "I’ve spent decades writing and editing; I know the feeling — of reward and hard-won clarity — that writing produces for me. But if you never build those muscles, will you grasp what’s missing when an L.L.M. delivers a chirpy but shallow reply? What happens to students who’ve never experienced the reward of pressing toward an elusive thought that yields itself in clear syntax? "But the generation growing up with A.I. will learn to think and write in its shadow. For them, the chatbot won’t be a tool to discover — as Netscape was for me — but part of the operating system itself. And that shift, from novelty to norm, is the profound transformation we’re only beginning to grapple with." <https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/opinion/ai-chatgpt-school.html>

..

Intro: make clear it's obvious things aren't going to turn out well for the protagonist, that it's obviously not face value. Link to reader somehow.

Via this linus vid: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIpdiQrFDU> 10'10'' - "AI is so wrongly used, when AI actually arrives, going to have to give it a different name" Interesting. So actually IPAI etc might have different name. What would it be? What are the options?

It's also interesting discussion of marketers "knowing what people will think when they hear AI", that they're doing it on purpose.

..

"The internet died not because people can be fooled by manipulated media - that's always been true. It died because synthetic media, like that created by Sora, ChatGPT, midjourney and others - can emulate human creativity at a scope and scale that is impossible for humans to engage with or sift through." <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaVjQFMg7L0> Book: infopocalypse. Cites example of Russian tactic of flooding with any information just to drown signal with noise. "Generative A.l Is the nuclear bomb of the information age."

Some extra plot based on identity theft e.g Crispin Glover and others

..

Replace lecture scene with: same room, but new students. First class? Wowing them? Open day? IP rep has to be there to make clear how all that works for uni. Noah is... monitoring? (It's an exhibition, which is close to open day...)

Or actually viva: testing them openly. Think through how that mixes with where tech went re. How they use it. \[Yes, like this. Public viva? Oh yes, again, see below!\]

Gives chance for playing out some tired IPs e.g. Hill is playing the "rebel who refuses to tow the line" cliches etc etc (better versions of that!)

Maybe a mix of prospective students and IP reps. Mull.

AND: something like a Viva. Papers are absolutely besides the point now - maybe have a paper spat out / think about what knoweldge system would be there, but the point is -- Viva because have to guarantee human input into that knowledge creation. The entire exhibition is like this, as is auction of course. Think through a bit. Retrofit.

Use all this to better build up to Hill trashing lab. Why is uni now so headfucking that it'll get her to that point? Try and make severity of what's happened much more clear, so the lab itself is the effect of the inciting incident, not the thing itself.

Note: if it's Remzi's viva, the lab destruction sets them against each other, puts him in quite a different situation. What would it be / how would that play out? "They put my promotion on hold." "No!" Hmm not sure I want to lean further into academia nonsense TBH!

..

Band names tru bet: tie it to start with to something in next class, so there's stakes there. Then tie to things unravelling for hill, and tru's response.

Tru can also be a bit of gambler, partly why it went wrong for him. (Compare to Nate Silver / River thing?)

Across line, tru can make names up, other two refuse or become quiet. "Go on try." See a bit what happens. Explain context a bit.

Actually, expand this. Tie to point below about hierarchy in school itself. Tru illustrates point by making them play Band Names either side of the line. One addition: either an extra person, or probably Remzi doesn't have same privileges as Hill \[no he doesn't before Viva!\] - so actually it costs him on that side of the line. They don't know it's there. Remzi does.

That's not a bad idea - viva can be Remzi getting extra privileges. Or Hill. Gonna have to piece that together.

(Remzi makes sense as it'll give more opps for building in tensions between them, things to work from, rather than adding fourth person.)

And it makes more sense why they always go outside line.

And! Maybe tru needs girlf who's outside line cos of moral choice / authents (authentic humans only zero other input but then do they do work randomising? Do we see that?)

..

Difficulty of researching poisons given IPAI system...? (Or not actually - make the point that it's NOT about surveillance.)

..

Add in some people with a mildly fanatical devotion to making sure their creative endeavours are untouched by machine. \[See above, Tru's girlfriend / boyfriend\]

..

Animals stories and how they end up involving John: I think maybe nope. They have to have more reason, more actual plot reason, to exist, rather than just making a point about memory? Do they? But what? \[Point about relative intelligence and personhood nonsense!\]

..

Famous father thing should come up again for Hill, maybe in first class. But why? What consequences? Some already built in.

...

A class of people in the school (support, estate, cleaning) with no library privileges who can't speak quite so easily. Turn up after lab trashed, other points? More on the metabolism of the building. Is one of them... Bernie? Some reason for being there? \[Ooo! Like!\]

...

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_academia> "One writer compared it to the contemporary cottagecore lifestyle aesthetic, saying that while cottagecore requires a home in the country and leisure time for crafting, dark academia's "simple act of putting on a blazer and reading Dostoevsky is far more doable."

Mulling, in relation to how the uni goes / Hill's rel to it, how she has to consiously shape herself and her view of herself given IPAI, and how that gets warped and twisted by Noah and others.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSecretHistory/comments/1akn5pf/the_secret_history_is_very_disappointing_but/> "the secret history doesn’t deconstruct dark academia, it is dark academia. it’s the popularity of the secret history (alongside the 2014 film kill your darlings) on tumblr during the early to mid 2010s that gave rise to the term “dark academia.” you can see both stories are very much about seemingly sophisticated and cultured university students going off the rails and committing brutal acts, hence the “dark” bit."

"But "dark academia" as the fashion/social trend isn't inevitably murderous. It's a cool aesthetic that people fetishise." Yeah - can imagine some people on the Street doing this, right? What's the uni's position to that? What am I doing with that?

..

"Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus, the actor Julianne Moore, the Radiohead singer Thom Yorke are among 10,500 signatories of a statement from the creative industries warning artificial intelligence companies that unlicensed use of their work is a “major, unjust threat” to artists’ livelihoods." <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/22/thom-yorke-and-julianne-moore-join-thousands-of-creatives-in-ai-warning>

PERFECT. Then we get dev of AI driven systems to "make sure everyone gets to own their IP" and away we go. \[So much more, what with other lawsuits, pirated books etc.\]

..

Bernie: dupes Hill into "checking" that he's the person she's working with, not Ipai. Common protocols to check identity and she fails. Otherwise - why would she trust the other person as not AI? What's the crack here?

..

Use ZRAIN protein chat as opening? \[What??\]

LINKS! \* <https://www.careful.industries/blog/2025-4-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-ai> \* The language in this abstract is kind of exactly the nonsense that could happen at the auction plus in IPAI-academia. Just awful! How did we get there? Fitting into epistemes oh no I'm doing it! <http://www.richard-hall.org/2024/02/15/generative-ai-and-re-weaving-a-pedagogical-horizon-of-social-possibility/>

..

AI and IPAI: if LLMs don't "understand" language and meaning... what innovations led later AI to have symbolic understanding? How did it demonstrate it? (Issue of how to know, that overlaps with what IPAI is trying to do with John, and why digging deeper into the language side does actually overlap this overall story.) (And why Symbolic species is so key; and why I got tricked into thinking LLMs did have symbolic understanding.)

..

There's increasingly absolutely no way to separate AI output from human speech even if verbal? Entirely mixed. Same as diff betw those old shoe makers and newer tech; so the writers' room is a facet of that (tho an entirely weird and false one). See e.g. <https://archive.ph/eMUYW>

The written word - did it die? Is that why writers' room so weird? It's why vivas happening.

\[How does that tie into John reading the book / writing there?\]

..

Bouncing off this: the "going into your mind to achieve some story goal" cliche. <https://youtu.be/4-pnloXSNrI?t=1787> How to do something with that that's actually interesting and useful and that does something good with the animal people? Hmmmm.
