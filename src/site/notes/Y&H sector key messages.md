## Some key messages

- [ ] Manufacturing strengths show up right across Y&H in many different ways in the data - strong in traditional locations, continuing growth in less obvious places (e.g. growth in food and chemical/petroleum manfacturing in east side of Y&H).
	- The specific SICs in the Industrial Strategy 'advanced manufacturing' list ([here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy/industrial-strategy-sector-definitions-list#advanced-manufacturing)) support that picture too (see the new figure 6 at the bottom [here](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/quarto_docs/Yorkshire_n_Humber_sectors_Nov2025.html#industrial-strategy-jobs-as-a-percent-of-each-places-whole-economy-for-each-is-8-change-over-time)). Those IS-8 sectors have a larger presence in different spots - Kirklees, East Riding, Calderdale as well as Rotherham.
	- The large increase in 'public/defence' supply chain concentration in Y&H might support this for defence connections (from the regional industry to industry payment flows, see the last plot [here](http://localhost:3430/quarto_docs/industry_to_industry_supply_chain_locality_2025.html)).
- High value financial services continue to be strong - outside of London, Y&H is second only to Scotland, with really large GVA growth (though not jobs growth) in Doncaster suggesting it could continue to develop.
	- The IS-8 finance LQs (grouping a range of finance SIC job counts) show jobs concentration in Calderdale too, though it appears in most places job numbers may be relatively reducing.
	- The sector-to-sector supply chain link / payment flow data might suggest and issue with this sector though. That huge Doncaster GVA increase is not accompanied by jobs growth, and finance shows up as one of the least supply-chain-connected sectors, with capital leaving regions.
- Telecoms / information tech in Y&H is growing in regional strength in the LQs, with Sheffield and Leeds also showing up in the IS-8 'digital' category as especially strong (including digital-relevant manufacture). The IS-8 LQs cover jobs growth, so don't have any of the 'what deflator are we using' issues that make this sector appear so productive.
- Related IS-8 'professional and business services' (PBS) is mixed, but with some important jobs growth stories across Y&H, especially in York, North Yorks, Kirklees and Barnsley (lower than average LQ but jobs shooting up).
- The group of sectors covered by the IS-8 '[Foundational](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy/industrial-strategy-sector-definitions-list#foundational-industries-and-inputs)' heading has very large LQs all across Y&H (only Leeds, Sheffield and York are below the GB average LQ). The region has a mix of sectors that add up to being a very strong centre for this part of the Industrial Strategy.
