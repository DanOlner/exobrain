Writing words that appear on the internet always has this weird vibe. I vaguely recall Bauman talking about it - synoptic not panoptic, where you're always looking out at everyone, always visible, but most likely no-one is looking. But they might. But they're not.

I'm backing off "all the things I thought writing should be for" and trying to play with it more. But why not just keep a doc on my own machine? What possible value is there in knowing someone could read this, in the depths of this elaborate online oubliette I've made for myself?

Dunno. Hence "experiment".

I'm writing this in Obsidian, a digital garden plugin is able to send it to Vercel, that builds it on my github, I've pointed a subdomain to it, and I just press CMD+P then 'publish active note' and it's live, and I can link to anything else on here. Those things make me irrationally happy. Let's go with that feeling, shall we?
