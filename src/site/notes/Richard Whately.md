# Why?

I got to Whately via [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics) on 'catallactics' - MIses and Hayek cite him as their source for the term. But after reading into Whately's thinking more, I'm struck by how much else from his work clearly informed Hayek (though Hayek himself doesn't cite him much).  

Born in the late 1700s and living through to the mid 1800s ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Whately)), I find Whately fascinating for his combination of sincere, dogged work on thinking rationally combined with 'scientific' examination of his religious beliefs and of the church's ideas at that point. The result is a flavourful, weird cocktail - and crucially, I think you can see some of that cocktail later in Hayek, though Hayek insists on the secular, evolved nature of his ideas.

Whately is - I think - a tad too early to have been fully immersed in the fallout from Darwinism and the any geological "hang on, this rock is reeeeaallly old" stuff going on at the time. (Though there's overlap).

Also (wikipedia again):
> In Oxford his white hat, rough white coat, and huge white dog earned for him the sobriquet of the White Bear.

That's quite an image.

# 'Introductory Lectures on Political Economy' (1831)

It's in his 'Introductory Lectures on Political Economy' (online version [here](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/whately-introductory-lectures-on-political-economy)) - delivered "Easter term MDCCCXXXI" (1831) at the University of Oxford that I've found the good stuff. Notes and thoughts on that below, and then we can see what questions come out of that.
