> Note: this page is a horrible hodgepodge of my ideas and chatGPT's output. In future I want to be very clear about what's human and not. It absolutely shouldn't be any different to standard citation practice - if there's ambiguity, that's plagiarism! That's without getting into all the common LLMs being industrial plagiarism machines. [Here's a search engine](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/search-libgen-data-set/682094/) to check if Meta's LLMs have used any of your work in a trove of pirated books they use. The rest do it too but hide it better.

## Starter questions

For any thought being chewed over, actually answer these!

* What do I actually want to say about this, right now, in the state I’m in?
* What tiny part of this could I write about today and call it “enough”?
* If this was just a blog note to my future self, what would I want to remember?
* How can I use this to nudge my ‘public self’ a tiny bit closer to my actual self?
* If no one else ever read this, what kind of change in _me_ would make it worthwhile? What’s one way I’d like to feel differently at the end of this writing session?

..

* Right now, what I’m really thinking about this is…
* The thing that keeps snagging my attention is…
* I’m not sure yet, but it might be that…
* One way this connects to my own work / life is…
* If I ignore the imaginary critics for a second, I’d like to say…

## Topic questions

* What is tugging at my attention about this topic? (A feeling, a confusion, an example, a quote, a conversation…)
* What puzzles me about it?
* What do I think I believe here – and where am I unsure or conflicted?
* What’s one concrete story, image, or example I could start with?

..

## What do I want from this writing?

* What do I want this piece to do for me? (Examples: help me think; show my working; vent; practice writing; build a public record; signal expertise; connect with others…)
* **What would a “minimum viable version” of this piece be?**  
(e.g. one example + one thought about it; a list of questions; a sketch rather than a full argument.)
* **Can I make “small, scruffy, partial” the default format?** Principle: assume every piece is allowed to be small and incomplete unless proven otherwise.
* **What would make me feel: “yup, I’m allowed to hit publish now”?** (Examples: I’ve made one clear point; I’ve captured the messy feeling while it’s fresh.)
* If this piece quietly succeeded on its own terms, what would that look like? (e.g. “I understand my own thinking better”, “one other nerd finds it useful”, “I’ve turned a messy feeling into words”.)
* What do I **not** want from this piece? (e.g. “I don’t need it to be definitive”; “it doesn’t have to impress X”; “I’m **not** doing a methods deep-dive here.”)
* Is there any pressure I can explicitly drop for this piece? (Name it: “This does not have to be the Big Final Argument About X.” Or: “I don’t know about this, I have questions…”)
* How does this connect (even loosely) to the kind of person / writer I’m trying to become?
* Who do I think this is for? If I don’t know, is it OK to say (and put in the title):  “This is an experiment – I’m writing to find out who this is for.”
* **What would I like the reader to feel or think at the end?**  (e.g. “Oh, I’m not the only one”; “That gives me a new angle”; “Huh, interesting question.”)

..

## Questions for allowing not knowing where it’s going:

Reminder again: if useful, use these for writing by directly answering.

* What am I curious about here, even if I have no idea what the conclusion is?
* What would I like to discover by writing this, not before?
* What are two or three genuine questions I have about this topic that I could share openly in the piece?
* If this ended up being nothing more than “field notes of my thinking”, would that still be worthwhile? Why / why not? [Tie that to ‘permission to hit publish’]

## Mid-writing/thinking questions for when it gets gnarly

* What makes this hard?
* What am I afraid of?
* Do I actually **want** to do this?
* Can I give this piece a title like ‘Unfinished thoughts on X’ and then stop when I hit that level?
* What is ‘Internal Reviewer 2’ saying about this right now? Do I agree? If not, what do I think? (Treat the academic/productivity voice as a character you can notice, not a truth you must obey.)
* Is the task mis-specified (too big, too vague, too boring, too scary)?
* Is it too painful to stay stuck like this? Do I want to **lean in and do it**, with new strategies? Or is it time to **let it go / change the goal**?
* Right now, am I writing as a human with a brain, or as a frightened employee trying to justify their job?

## Functions of writing: expanding the available options

Let’s start with the ones that we often mistake for the _only_ available options - professional functions.

### Professional functions:

* Signal expertise - show I understand a topic, explain it to others (‘expert mode’).
* Show how I think - “here’s how I approach problems.”
* Translate jargon into human - take something technical and make it readable (sci-comms etc).
* Record insight from client / project work - anonymised lessons learnt.
* Lay groundwork for a bigger piece - “proto-chapter” or seed of an article. (‘working paper mode’.)

..

* Turn mess into a rough map – summarise notes / readings into a skeleton.
* Draft instructions for myself – “next time I do this workflow, follow these steps.”
* Document a process or project – what I tried, what worked, what didn’t.
* Make a to-think list, not just a to-do list – park open questions somewhere.
* Archive the context – so future-me doesn’t have to reconstruct “what was going on when I made this decision?”

### Functions for my own brain:

* Help me think – untangle a knot, see what I actually believe.
* Show my working (to myself) – externalise a chain of thought so I don’t have to hold it all in working memory.
* Capture a fleeting idea – get something down before it evaporates.
* Make the vague concrete – turn “a sense of something” into sentences / test a hunch – see if an intuition still makes sense when written out.
* Clarify priorities – figure out what matters most about a topic.
* Decide what **not** to do – write through a possibility just to decide to drop it.
* Store a snapshot of where I am now – so future-me can see how my thinking changed.
* Map the edges of what I don’t know – list questions, uncertainties, contradictions.

## Emotional / psychological functions

* Vent – get frustration, anger, or anxiety out of my head and onto the page.
* Soothe myself – write something kind (to myself!), explanatory, or grounding.
* Defang a shame story – tell it in my own words so it has less power.
* Celebrate a win or joy – note what went well before it gets forgotten.
* Process grief / loss / disappointment – give it shape and language.
* Reassure future-me – a note from now-me to the version who will freak out later.
* Boost confidence – prove to myself I can start / finish a thing.

## Others in mind

* Tell someone a story – “here’s what happened” or “here’s how this feels.”
* Connect with others who experience similar things – “if you recognise this, you’re not alone.”
* Start a conversation – put something out there so people can respond.
* Invite help or feedback – “here’s where I’m stuck; what do you see?”
* Offer comfort – write something that might reassure or support someone else.

### Experiment

* Play – language play, silly ideas, metaphors, weird structures; enjoying writing as a toy.
* Try out a voice – more casual, more nerdy, more personal, more ranty.
* Experiment with form – lists, dialogues, letters, field notes, Q&A, “conversation with myself”.
* Put two areas in dialogue – e.g. data + lived experience.
* Test whether a topic has “juice” – do I actually enjoy writing about this when I try?
* See what emerges if I don’t plan – commit to discovery writing.

### “Enough to hit publish” functions

* Deliberately make a small thing – prove that a 500-word note is valid.
* Practice stopping – write until X minutes or Y words, then quit on purpose.
* Turn a huge topic into “part 1” – explicitly make this one slice, not the whole cake.
* Close a loop – finish capturing a thread so my brain can let it go.

### “My identity” functions

* Build a public record of my thinking – “here’s how my ideas evolved over time."
* Assert authorship over my own story – write how I see my path, not just how institutions see it.
* Practice being the person I want to be – “someone who shares their process”, “someone who writes honestly about ADHD + work”, etc.
* Reclaim topics from perfectionism – show they don’t have to live only in formal papers / reports.
* Create an “I was here” trace – a small mark that I existed and thought about this.
