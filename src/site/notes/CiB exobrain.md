[Coveredinbees](https://coveredinbees.org) exobrain. Hi there.

As [ngrams shows](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=exobrain%2Cdigital+garden&year_start=1960&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3&case_insensitive=false), I've very much got my finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist with 'exobrain'. Note also its earliest use Google finds - 1970, in Arthur B. Bronwell’s ‘Science and Technology in the World of the Future’: 

> “to carry out man’s informational processing demands in much the same way that an exoskeleton carries out his powerful tasks.”

The #brainsystems tag links to things that overlap. And [here's a CiB post](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/why-make-things-simple/) on the whys and hows.
