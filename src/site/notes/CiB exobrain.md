[Coveredinbees](https://coveredinbees.org) exobrain. Hi there.

If you find a link goes to a 404 page, it's because it's not published here but still connected in my own local [Obsidian vault](https://help.obsidian.md/vault).

As [ngrams shows](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=exobrain%2Cdigital+garden&year_start=1960&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3&case_insensitive=false), I've very much got my finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist with 'exobrain'. Note also its earliest use Google finds - 1970, in Arthur B. Bronwell’s ‘Science and Technology in the World of the Future’: 

> “... to carry out man’s informational processing demands in much the same way that an exoskeleton carries out his powerful tasks.”

Really, the 'digital garden' metaphor is more apt (and might be why it's on the rise while exobrain fades); [here's](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) a nice writeup of the idea (and the [digital garden obsidian plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev) I'm using to do it). The point: tending to a garden is a much more organic, low-cognitive-effort process where you just turn up and tend to whatever seems like it needs tending to. As long as you turn up, a lot of the rest takes care of itself (see [[Andy Matuschak on notes\|my notes on Andy Matuschak's notes]] for more thoughts on this process). An exobrain in contrast is [what that Colonel in Avatar wears](https://james-camerons-avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Amplified_Mobility_Platform)...

The #brainsystems tag links to things that overlap. And [here's a CiB post](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/why-make-things-simple/) on the whys and hows.
