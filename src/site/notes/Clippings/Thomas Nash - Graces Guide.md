**1903 Obituary [^2]**

THOMAS NASH was born in Swindon on 1st March 1838.

After receiving an elementary education he was apprenticed at the locomotive works of the Great Western Railway Co.

He had barely attained his majority when, in 1858, he obtained an appointment as engineer in connection with the [Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway](https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Bombay,_Baroda_and_Central_India_Railway "Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway"). He remained in India for about eleven years, but the trying climate eventually affected his health, and he was obliged to come back to England.

He then acted as inspecting engineer in Glasgow for the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway until 1873, when he commenced business as a consulting and inspecting engineer in Sheffield.

In 1880 he conceived the idea of establishing an independent testing and experimenting works in Sheffield. He took great pride in turning out accurate work, with the result that his business grew rapidly, and he found it advisable to add a chemical laboratory to his mechanical testing laboratory. In the course of his work he was frequently consulted regarding breakdowns of various kinds.

He took no prominent part in politics or municipal work, but devoted himself unremittingly to his business, to which he was much attached. At the close of last year, being in failing health, he disposed of his business to his son, but only survived his retirement for a short time.

He was a sufferer from bronchitis ever since his return from India, and he died at his residence at Nether Edge, Sheffield, on 24th February 1903, in his sixty-fifth year.

He became a Member of this Institution in 1889, and was also a member of the Iron and Steel Institute.
