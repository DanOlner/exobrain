- [ ] Think about the composition point: productivity up but not the same people

Acemoglu, D., Restrepo, P., 2018. The Race between Man and Machine: Implications of Technology for Growth, Factor Shares, and Employment. American Economic Review 108, 1488–1542. [https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20160696](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20160696)

“Herein lies our answer to Leontief’s analogy: the difference between human labor and horses is that humans have a comparative advantage in new and more complex tasks. Horses did not. If this comparative advantage is significant and the creation of new tasks continues, employment and the labor share can remain stable in the long run even in the face of rapid automation.” 1489

..

But: “Mechanization (e.g., in bootmaking, textiles, iron and steel) often created as many jobs as it destroyed, but the new jobs were different and didn't tend to go to those displaced from the old ones. This resulted in persistent unemployment for some segments, while others benefited from expanding job opportunities in newly created sectors.”

Which is paraphrasing: “While several papers find that new jobs were generated to replace those lost to new labor-saving technologies, access to these new employment opportunities was stratified by gender, age, education, and geographical location. Incumbents whose skills were rendered obsolete by new technologies may have had limited opportunity to move into newly created jobs.” p.16.
